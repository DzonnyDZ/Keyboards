Klingon Phonetic Keyboard 0.9.0 CzTlh
=====================================
* To install run setup.exe
* To uninstall goto Add/Remove programs control panel
* This layout allows entering Klingon characters and their lating counterpart
* To use Klingon characters you need Unicode Klingon font that follows ConScript Unicode Registry Klingon mapping such as Code 2000 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/code2000/)
* Unlike other keyboards this keyboard does not add itself to Langauge bar as part of setup process (that's because windows does not have built-in support for Klingon).
* You must add it to language bar by right-clicking it, going to setup, chosing add, selecting any language and there selecting Klingon Phonetic keyboard (exact steps vary by OS version).
